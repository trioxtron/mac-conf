# MacOS Config

This repository to simplify the process of setting up a new Mac.
It includes a list of software, configurations, and tools that I use on a daily basis.
It's based on homebrew to keep everything up to date and the applications in sync across multiple machines.

Have a look into the [Makefile](Makefile) to see all available commands.

The repository also contains configuration files for the following tools:

- Karabiner-Elements
- rectangle
- iterm2
